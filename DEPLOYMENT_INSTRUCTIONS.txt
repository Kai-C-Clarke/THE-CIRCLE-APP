DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS - Multi-Role Family Selection Update
================================================================

CHANGES MADE:
-------------
✓ Replaced single-select dropdown with multi-select checkboxes for family roles
✓ Users can now select multiple roles (e.g., Grandmother, Daughter, Cousin, Sister)
✓ Added visual feedback when roles are selected
✓ Responsive design for iPad and mobile devices
✓ Added two new role options: Aunt/Uncle and Niece/Nephew

FILES TO UPDATE:
---------------

1. index.html
   Location: /templates/index.html (or root directory)
   Purpose: Updated HTML structure with checkbox interface

2. style.css
   Location: /static/css/style.css
   Purpose: Added styling for checkbox group and responsive design

3. profile.js
   Location: /static/js/profile.js
   Purpose: Updated JavaScript to handle multiple role selections

GIT COMMANDS:
-------------
git add .gitignore
git add templates/index.html
git add static/css/style.css
git add static/js/profile.js
git commit -m "Add multi-select family roles with checkboxes"
git push origin main

TESTING:
--------
After deployment:
1. Clear browser cache or hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Visit the homepage
3. Select multiple family roles
4. Verify roles are saved correctly (they will be stored as comma-separated values)
5. Test on iPad to ensure proper display

DATABASE:
---------
No database changes needed! The family_role field already stores TEXT,
so multiple roles will be stored as: "Grandmother, Daughter, Cousin, Sister"

BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY:
-----------------------
Existing single-role profiles will continue to work.
Users can edit their profile to add multiple roles.
